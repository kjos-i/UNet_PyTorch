# UNet implementation using PyTorch

This is a very simple UNet implementation 


## Quick start

1. For this UNet implementation, the image masks must be binary with background = 0 and class label = 1

2. Make sure to have a separate test dataset. Arrange your training dataset (training and validation combined) like this:

3. Download the four .py files to one folder:

4. Open the UNet_PyTorch_training.py file in an editor (for example VS Code) and set these variables:

5. Check that the Python environment has all necessary packages installed, otherwise install them

6. Run the UNet_PyTorch_training.py file

7. The results will be stored in a new folder at the specified save path
